# Scriptorium
Scriptorium is an innovative online platform designed for geeks, nerds, and coding enthusiasts to write, execute, and share code in multiple programming languages. Inspired by the concept of ancient scriptoria, where manuscripts were crafted and preserved, Scriptorium modernizes this idea for the digital age, providing a secure and interactive environment for experimenting, refining, and reusing code snippets. Whether youâ€™re testing a quick snippet or building reusable code templates, Scriptorium is your ideal tool for bringing your ideas to life.

NOTE: This project was created for the course CSC309 at the University of Toronto. It aims to build a fully-functional web application using Next.js, Prisma, React, TailwindCSS, and Docker.

# Features
- Code Writing & Execution: Write and execute code in languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- Code Templates: Save, organize, and share reusable code templates.
- Blog Integration: Create, edit, and read blog posts with embedded code examples.
- User Authentication: Sign up, log in, and manage profiles.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive user interface for various devices.
- Dark/Light Themes: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable coding.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
